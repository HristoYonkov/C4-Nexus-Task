## Informaton:
Short summary:

I solve this problem with 'React' librares. As a part of the task i use hardcoded data,
this data is inside 'src/data' folder. And by this approach the app is not persistant,
all states will be lost after refresh of the page!
However, the state is well managed and if you cycle trough pages it wont be deleted!
I use props drilling approach with this task cause i started it so, i thought that the things will be more easy
but when i get to 'filtering part + sorting' things get started more challenging :).
